              <span class="style15">Thursday, October 24, 1929 triggered the Great Depression.  In the  depths of the fallen economy, there was either long days of hard work with minimum pay, or  unemployment. Morale was low and Alabamians needed a boost! Then public communications took a significant upturn!  </span></p>
          <p class="style6"><span class="style15">On February 7,  1930, the Mobile Press and News Item launched  the first radio  station in Mobile, WODX.  Residents of the Gulf Coast could now hear world  news and local events first hand.<br />
              <br />
            Within two weeks, John F. Glennon, prominent businessman and well known  Alabama historian, was sponsored by the Mobile Real Estate Board, to  promote the culture, scenery and attributes of the Mobile area.  In  January, 1935, the Old Narrator, as Glennon called himself, began a  series on Highlights in Alabama History.  The series aired 3 times a  week for 2 years, with stories about Alabama's past.  He told of  rivalries, romance and  adventure and gave listeners incentive to feel better about themselves and  their well-being.<br />
              <br />
            This book covers 62 of 192 recently discovered radio scripts, providing  insight into Alabama history as it was known in the 30s.<br />

            <p class="style6"><br />
              <span class="style15">On a riverboat between Montgomery and Mobile, AL, in the mid-1800s, a  wager of $10,000 was set as the challenge that slaves from Africa could  no longer be brought into the United States.  The schooner &quot;Clotilde&quot;  was secretly dispatched and returned in July 1860 with 115 Africans.  They were smuggled ashore and sold to various plantation owners.<br />
              <br />
This story follows the life of Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis from capture in  Dahomey to freedom after the War Between The States.  Cudjoe became a  leader of the formerly enslaved villagers of Tarkar, as they settled in  Africatown, north of Mobile, to become the only settlement in the  United States to speak a pure African dialect.  <br />
<br />
This true story was found in a tattered envelope that was tucked  away in 1935 and remained unopened until 1997! Research revealed the  facts behind several  discussions in 1932 with Cudjoe by Rosemary Glennon and  documents Cudjoe's life and the last slave voyage to America.</span></p>

              <p class="style16">In 1827, South Marion County was placed on the Seminole Indian  Reservation for a brief time while the Governor of Florida negotiated  relocation with the Indians.   About 30 miles to the southwest, the  Indians had left their victorious mark on the Dade Battlefield.</p>
            <p class="style16">About 10 miles north, Ma Barker and her son ended their rampage of  crime in a shootout with Federal agents. Nearby in 1935, the infamous  Cross Florida Canal was started.  The project was funded and squelched  for the third and final time in 1964, by President Johnson.<br />
